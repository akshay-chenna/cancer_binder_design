The structure of TGFbR2 from 1KTZ is chosen as its of a higher resolution. (1KTZ_tgfbr2_cleaned_renum.pdb)
AF3 poses are not required, as the missing residues are disordered anyway.
Interface residues on 1KTZ_cleaned/ chosen hotspots on 1KTZ_tgfbr2_cleaned.pdb:
L27, S49-I53, D118, E119
Final hotspots in 1KTZ_tgfbr2_cleaned_renum.pdb: L3, S24-I29, D94, E95
