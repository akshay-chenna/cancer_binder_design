Structures: Structures of unique neo-peptides that are conformationally different from the native peptides. Obtained from clustering and cross trajectory RMSD calculations. /home/akshay/Desktop/cancer/hla_kras12d/neo_md/pepaa/split_pdbs
		* model_0_neo: from AF3
run_1: bindcraft minibinder design, using only A4-8 of the peptides as hotspots. hotspot_weight=10, flexible, hardtarget settings.
run_2: bindcraft minibinder design. Using A4-8 and a radial patch around it as hotspots. hotspots_weight=10, flexible, hardtarget settings. only AF3 model used.
