run_6
Germinal ScFv design against GPC3 hotspots:
Used structure correct_uniprot_gpc3_59-477_hotspot2.pdb
The goal is to design binders to the outer surface of GPC3 rather than the internal surface that run_1 has produced to.
Hotspots: 301,467,471,393,400, Renumbered: A22,A73,A77,A42,A49
Parameters changed for VHH and ScFv runs -- mostly from IL13 and PDL1 runs.
