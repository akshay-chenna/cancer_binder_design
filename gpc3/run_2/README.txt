Minibinder design runs with hotspots and trimmed structure.
/paperspace/Desktop/cancer/gpc3/run_2
Used structure correct_uniprot_gpc3_59-477_hotspot1.pdb
 The goal is to design binders to the outer surface of GPC3 rather than the internal surface that run_1 has produced to.
Hotspots: 117, 125, 214, 311, 313, 314, 324, 333
