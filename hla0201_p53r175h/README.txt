1. run_1: Protein hunter design targeting 6W51 pdb.
2. run_2: Bindcraft designs target 6W51 pdb with radial hotspots (4.5 A from pymol), around R175H.
3. run_3: Boltzgen minibnder runs with radial hotspots (as above). Residues are slightly renumbered.
4. run_4: Mosaic runs with competing potentials.
5. run_5: Modal bindcraft runs with peptide only hotspots. Enhanced weights. Hotspot adherence rate is twice as that from full radial hotspots (run_2)
6. run_6: Modal protein-hunter runs with peptide only hotspots. With templates -- SHARED by anirudh.


Structures:
6w51_cleaned.cif/.fasta -- shared by anirudh
Rest: prepared by me, do not work with protein-hunter
